/*! Endian conversion trait

This trait declares methods that perform endian conversions on data types. For
the primitives, which are essentially atomic in structure, this conversion is
simple: flip all their bytes around. This conversion is also defined as inherent
methods on the integral primitives, so `Endian::from_be(n: i32)` is equivalent
to `::std::i32::from_be(n: i32)`
